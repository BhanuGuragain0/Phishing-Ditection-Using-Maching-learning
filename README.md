# Phishing Email Detection

This repository contains scripts to generate phishing and non-phishing emails and to train and utilize a machine learning model for phishing email detection.

## Overview

The project consists of two main scripts:

1. **csv_maker.py**: This script generates a dataset of phishing and non-phishing emails.
2. **email_checker.py**: This script trains a logistic regression model to detect phishing emails and allows users to check emails for phishing attempts.

## Features

- **Email Dataset Generation**: Generate a large dataset of phishing and non-phishing emails.
- **Model Training**: Train a logistic regression model to detect phishing emails.
- **Email Prediction**: Check if a given email is phishing or not using the trained model.
- **Report Generation**: Generate a report of predictions for multiple emails.


## Usage
```
### Generating the Email Dataset

Use `csv_maker.py` to generate a dataset of emails.

python csv_maker.py --num_emails 100000 --file_path ./email_data.csv

    --num_emails: Number of emails to generate.
    --file_path: Path to save the generated CSV file.

Training the Model and Checking Emails

Check emails for phishing:

    python email_checker.py

Follow the prompts to enter email texts and check if they are phishing or not.
